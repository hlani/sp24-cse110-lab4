1. 3
2. 150
3. 150
4. This function would return the array [50,100,150]. This occurs because of the for loop that calculates the final price given the discoiunt. Then, it is pushed to the array. Applying the discounts to the given prices.
5. We would get an error because ```let``` is block-scoped limited. Thus, ```'i'``` would not be printed. 
6. An error will occur because ```let discountedPrice```is declared in a different block scope. 
7. 150
8. This function will also return the array [50,100,150]. Although the variable declarations are different, this function will return the same. 
9. Would get an error because ```i``` is defined and restricted to the blockscope that it is part of. Therefore, calling ```i``` outside the blockscope will not print the value. 
10. 3
11. This function will return the array [50,100,150]. The variables are different but the core function remains the same across all the functions. 
12. - A. student.name
    - B. student['Grad year']
    - C. student.greeting()
    - D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    - E. student.courseload[0]
13. - A. '3' + 2 = '32' : Assumes that we are adding an integer to a string, concatenation occurs
    - B. '3' - 2 = 1 : The subtraction sign is not part of strings, thus it converts '3' to an int. 
    - C. 3 + null = 3 : Null is considered to be a zero, hence this is equivalent to 3 + 0
    - D. '3' + null = '3null' : Concatenation occurs because '3' is a string. 
    - E. true + 3 = 4 : true is converted to a 1 
    - F. false + null = 0 : False is equivalent to zero and null is 0, the equation results in 0
    - G. '3' + undefined = '3undefined' : String cocatenation occurs
    - H. '3' - undefined = NaN : subtraction is not part of string operations. So, 3 is converted to an int and undefined is converted to NaN. Anything with NaN, results in NaN. 
14. - A.  '2' > 1 = true : the string '2' is converted to an int, making the comparison true
    - B. '2' < '12'= false: This compares on the lexicographic order, and 2 is actually greater than 1.
    - C. 2 == '2' = true: Converts the string '2' to an int before making the comparison. 
    - D. 2 === '2' = false: Strictly checks the value and type without any conversion.
    - E. true == 2 = false: True as an int is converted to 1 and is not equivalent to 2. 
    - F. true === Boolean(2) = true: Boolean(2) is the same as true and is the same type and value, results in true.    
15. The primary difference between ```==``` and ```===``` is that one of them include
