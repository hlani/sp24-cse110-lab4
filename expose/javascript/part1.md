4. ReferenceError - Got an error because ```let results``` was declared in a block scope that was not part of of the  ```"final result"``` print. Thus, we got an error.
5. TypeError - Constant variables can not be changed. As a result, num1 + num2 is not allowed because we can not assign it a new value.
6. Error - Nothing is printed because of TypeError for the constant variable
but even if there weren't, the ```const``` was declared in the block scope. Hence, the ```"final result"``` would still not be printed even if the const variable was valid..
